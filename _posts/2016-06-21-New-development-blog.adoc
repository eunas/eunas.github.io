= New development blog
:hp-tags: gotdeb, Blog, Open Source,

I been working on and off on Gotdeb for a couple of years now, and it's really just a script that I use for my personal servers (25 and counting :) )

Recently I discovered that other people are using the script for their servers as well. So I decided to make this blog for updates and feature development plans.

Do not hesitate to make a pull request if you have any ideas or changes to the script. I'm always looking to improve it.
